Bluetooth Volume Manager can react to Bluetooth devices connecting or disconnecting.
It allows Android to remember the volume levels of different Bluetooth devices.

可用功能：
• Music, call, ringtone and notification volume adjustment.
• Sending out 'Play' or 'Next' media commands.
• Opening a specific app.
• Keeping the screen awake.
• Preventing the volume from being changed.
• Restoring previous volume levels after disconnect.

This app can't "boost" your volume or change the volume if you can't change it through your device's volume buttons manually.

權限說明：
• '網路' 用於回報錯誤。
• '藍芽' 用於運作藍芽裝置。
• '變更音訊設定' 用於變換音量。
• 'Boot completed' to restore volume levels after reboots.
• 'WAKE_LOCK' to fix a bug on Samsung devices and to keep the screen awake if necessary.
• 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' to launch apps when a Bluetooth device connects (only on Android 10).
